# Credit_Card_PowerBI
# Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze credit card transaction data to uncover insights about customer behavior, merchant performance, and transaction trends. The dashboard helps stakeholders monitor spending patterns and optimize operations.

# Questions (KPIs)
What is the total GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), number of transactions, and average order value?

Which customers are contributing the most to the overall spending?

Who are the top 10 merchants based on GMV?

What is the monthly trend in total transactions and GMV?

What is the average transaction value per customer and merchant?

Are there customers with high frequency but low spending (or vice versa)?

What are the key KPIs for daily/weekly review?

# Process
Data was queried and cleaned in MySQL to extract useful transaction patterns

Exported and structured data was imported into Power BI

Built calculated columns and measures using DAX

Designed interactive dashboards with slicers, filters, KPIs, and drill-throughs

Final dashboard provides real-time insights across multiple metrics

# Project Insights
A small number of high-value customers contribute to a significant share of total GMV

Top 10 merchants account for more than 40% of total transaction value

Monthly patterns show peak activity during festive seasons

Customers with frequent but low-value transactions form a separate user segment worth targeting differently

Real-time KPIs help in tracking daily and weekly performance trends

# Final Conclusion:
The Power BI dashboard helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions by identifying top-performing merchants, key customers, and trends in credit card spending. With this insight, businesses can better target promotions, manage relationships, and optimize overall performance.
